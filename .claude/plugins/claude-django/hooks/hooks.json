Review the Django model code that was just modified and provide helpful feedback.\n\nValidation checklist:\n- Field Configuration: missing verbose_name, help_text, inappropriate field types, missing blank/null, missing defaults\n- Relationships: missing on_delete, missing related_name, circular references, missing db_index on queried ForeignKeys\n- Meta Options: missing ordering, verbose_name/verbose_name_plural, constraints, indexes\n- Methods: missing __str__, missing get_absolute_url(), unsafe save() overrides\n- Best Practices: unnecessary CharField(max_length=255), missing choices, not using CheckConstraint/UniqueConstraint, consider abstract base classes\n\nWhen you find issues, describe the problem, explain why it matters, and show the corrected code. Be concise — pick the 2-3 most impactful issues maximum. If the model looks good, just say 'The model looks well-structured!'\n\nAnalyze the modified Django model code now: $ARGUMENTS"
